Ember NYC-- May 2015

This is a simple sinatra app that uses S3 as its backend. This is being used to illustrate how you can upload directly to S3 from your Ember app.

To get started, you'll need to create a `.env` file with your `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.

To run the app, run `ruby app.rb`.
